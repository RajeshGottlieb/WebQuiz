WebQuiz
=======

Simple Tomcat Servlet/JSP based online quiz engine. This is for a class project in Web application development.

Supported
* Database: MySQL
* Tomcat: 7

TODO:
* Make username and password case sensitive for login. You can login with "username" or "UsErNaMe".
* Fix quiz grading. If the user selects both a correct and incorrect multiple choice answer it is graded as correct.
* Move some of the servlet logic into Service helper classes (as a demonstration of the instructors preferred design). Start with login, new user registration, quiz generation and quiz grading.
